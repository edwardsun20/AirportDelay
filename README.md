# AirportDelay
R code for hypothesis testing of US arrival/departure delay times data frame

In our project, we looked at two data sets containing all domestic flight records occuring in the US 
in January and August of 2018. Two sample t-tests for averages of Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were performed
with ggplot2.
